# Landing Page Project

## Project description
The project's functionality is to focus on the required section when you click the section name from the navigation bar and activate the current section when you focus on.
It also makes the number of elements of the navigation bar dynamic according to the number of sections in the html file.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
